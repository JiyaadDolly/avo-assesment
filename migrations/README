Generic single-database configuration.

This is a task to assess your python and fastapi skills

Tech used here
 - alembic for migrations
 - poetry for packages 
 - sqlalchemy for db queries
 - fastapi for the server
 - this folder was created with manage-fastapi

 The Task is in 2 parts
 - Fix the broken migration
 - Add user login and provide an example of a protected route (can use fastapi-users for this or any external library so we can test if you can add libraries)

 
 App usage:

 - install poetry 
    `https://python-poetry.org/docs/`

- create a shell  
    `poetry shell`

- install dependencies
    `poetry install`

- run the app with 
    `fastapi run`
